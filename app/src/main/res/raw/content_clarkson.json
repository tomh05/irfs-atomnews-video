{"name":"Topgear", "body":"The show looked quite different when it began in 1977. It started off as a general motoring show, looking at and reviewing the latest cars. It was presented by Angela Rippon, and became one of the BBC’s most watched programmes during the 1980s. After Jeremy Clarkson joined in 1988, the show became edgier and more controversial.\n\nAfter Jeremy Clarkson resigned in Top Gear in 1999, the show suffered and bosses decided to change the format. ‘New Top Gear’, filmed in Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, became an instant hit. Clarkson was soon joined by Richard Hammond and James May, and together the three made Top Gear into a national cultural icon."}]
